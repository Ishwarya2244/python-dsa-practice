DSA DAY 5 - AVERAGE OF ELEMENTS

Goal:
Find the average of all elements in a list.

Formula:

Average = Sum / Count

Example:

numbers = [8, 12, 20]

total = 0
count = 0

for x in numbers:
    total += x
    count += 1

average = total / count

print(average)

Output:

13.333333333333334

Logic:

1. Start total = 0
2. Start count = 0
3. Visit each element using a loop
4. Add element to total
5. Increase count by 1
6. Calculate average = total / count
7. Print average

Important:

total += x   -> Used for SUM

count += 1  -> Used for COUNT

average = total / count

Memory Trick:

Largest Number  -> if x > largest

Smallest Number -> if x < smallest

Count Elements  -> count += 1

Sum Elements    -> total += x


Average         -> total / count


*********DSA Day 5 Coding Challenge********

Now write the code yourself.

Find the average of:

numbers = [10, 20, 30, 40]

Expected Output:

25
Hint

You need:

total = 0
count = 0

Then inside the loop:

total += x
count += 1

After the loop:

average = total / count

and print the average.

This is the first DSA problem where you're combining two previous concepts:

Count Elements
        +
Sum Elements
        =
Average of Elements



code****

numbers = [10, 20, 30, 40]
total=0
count=0
for x in numbers:
    total+=x
    count+=1
average=total/count
print(average)

Write a program to find the average of:

numbers = [5, 10, 15, 20]

Expected output:

12.5


numbers = [5, 10, 15, 20]
total=0
count=0
for x in numbers:
    total+=x
    count+=1
average=total/count
print(average)


One Final Challenge

Write a program to find the average of:

numbers = [8, 12, 20]

Expected output:

13.333333333333334

numbers = [8, 12, 20]
total=0
count=0
for x in numbers:
    total+=x
    count+=1
avg=total/count
print(avg)
